## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Random seed functionality and single-day play. In order to achieve a level of community and competitive spirit, it was necessary to make sure players were playing the same game, e.g. the same starting letters and locations, on any given day. This is done by using a simple datetime.today() function and then building that into a single number. This number is seed value for all random operations in the game. Thus allowing players across the globe to be playing with the same board from day to day.
